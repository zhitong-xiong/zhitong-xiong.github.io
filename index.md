## About Me

I received the B.E. degree in Software Engineering, the M.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science
and Technology from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xiâ€™an, China, in 2015, 2018 and 2021, respectively. My research interests lie broadly
in the area of deep learning, remote sensing, computer vision, and Earth observation. Currently, I am a senior research scientist working on
remote sensing and Earth observation with Prof. Xiaoxiang Zhu at the department of Data Science in Earth Observation, Technical University
of Munich. More Specifically, I am serving as the leader of the [ML4Earth working group](https://ml4earth.de/). I am also working on
the project [Energy-efficient AI for Extreme Weather Events Forecasting](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/sipeo/projects/ekapex/),
which aims to fight against climate change with machine learning and Earth observation technologies.
